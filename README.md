# CatMeownity

A Cat neighbourhood community app!

## Description

Add your community cats to the site to share the joy they bring with your neighbours. Track your favourite cats and help the cat-community by adding their feeding times, and alerting others that they are missing. Leave your descriptions for the cats so others will know what our furry friends are like!

To my team, Hafiz and Saiful, who helped built it to my vision - and very well.

And to all the furry friends that I will make.
